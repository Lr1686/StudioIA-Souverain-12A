## 2026-03-30 - Stream line counting vs JSON deserialization for record tracking

**Learning:** In `gestion_pionniers.py`, JSON Lines records were being fully deserialized (`json.loads`) into memory dicts when only record count was required for capacity checks and ID generation. Replacing `json.loads` parsing with streaming line counting (`sum(1 for line in f if line.strip())`) achieves ~4x speedup and O(1) memory usage.
**Action:** Avoid deep deserialization of JSON/JSONL when only line or record counts are needed for ID generation or limit validation.
